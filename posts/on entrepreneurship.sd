# On entrepreneurship

For a long time, my working definition
for entrepreneurship would have been something like
"creating a company" or "starting a business". Something
about the act of the company or business, to me, sounded
fundamental to the act.

But now, I've a got new definition of entrepreneurship
that I'd like to share, and I think it's much more precise
and much more powerful.

# New definition

And that defintion is this: 

Entrepreneurship is using money to motivate action to
arrive at a creation of some sort.

I think with this definition I'm able to interpret the world
around me way better than before. Like I can finally see what
is happening when people "do" entrepreneurship.

The problem with the previous examples of the definition
of entrepreneurship is that they miss the point entirely:
Entrepreneurship is about creating something.
"A business" is too vague, it's too weak.

In actuality a "business" is supposed to be a creation
achieved through the motivation of money. That's why 
"starting a business" might seen like entrepreneurship, but
only when we observe it through this lens after the fact. 

# The problem with creating something

The problem with creating something is that it's hard. It's
actually kind of difficult and at times unpleasant. Sometimes,
the only beautiful part of the creation is at the beginning
and there's a very large amount of boring and frustrating drudge 
work ahead. It is at this precise point that motivation is needed.

# Motivation

Most of life, I think, is dictated by what we do. And usually we
do what we are motivated to do. If you are hungry, you are motivated
to eat. If you are sleepy, to sleep. Apart from these biological motivations
we can be motivated for other things, like status, wealth, passion, love,
vengence, emotions, religion, and others. If you want to do something 
(rationally), to actually accomplish it you will need motivation. Or
else it will be thought experiment as "just thinking" of something to
do won't make you do it.

So now we have: 

- motivations

- things that we want to do

The path forward is simple: we pair what we want to do with right
motivations, so that we can accomplish those things.

# Strength of motivations

The problem is that not all motivation is created equal. For example,
for most people the motivation of being desirable for having a six-pack
is not enough to force them into having a six-pack. So, we have a
motivation mis-match. That is to say, for most people the "fitness
to look good" motivation is kind of weak. Not all people of course,
but most people.

Another weak motivation is "novelty". Just doing something because it's
new. Like learning a new skill or programming language. With this 
motivation, as soon as the first real difficult portion is encountered,
you will quit. 

This has happened to me countless times. Half-coded projects, half-written
posts, half-made songs. At the first sign of struggle I simply quit, 
because naturally it wasn't worth it for me to push through.

Now, you know what's a hard thing to do? Creation. Creating something
new and putting it into the world. Creating something new, naturally,
is all about moving forward with no leader, no prior example doing 
exactly what you did (or else you wouldn't be creating anything). 

Naturally you cannot be misled if you have no leader. But you
must also face the ambiguity and all the axiety it produces. 

So to create something of substance, something large and difficult,
you need a large and powerful motivator.

# Money

Money is truly magic. It creates energy where there was none.
It can keep people awake, thinking, and pushing through tons and tons
and TONS of dreadful boring awful work. Other motivations, such as love,
might be able to do this as well, but not with nearly the stoic
consistency as money can.

Of course, this is often a bad thing. We all know people will do
some pretty horrible things for money. But that's the key point:
People WILL DO things. Good things, bad things. Money is the energy
machine. Point and shoot, things happen. The doing gets done.

# Conclusion

Money as a powerful motivator can cause many different things, some
good some bad, others neutral.

So who is the entrepreneur? 

They are the person who has harnessed the power of money and are
using it for the purpose of creating something new.

The entrepreneur sees something in the world which they wish to create
, then point the money-energy-beam-gun at themselves because they know
it's the only way to actually create the thing.

In short: 

Entrepreneurship is using money to motivate action to
arrive at a creation of some sort.

May we create great things friends.
